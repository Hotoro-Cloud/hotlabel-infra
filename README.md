# HotLabel Infrastructure

This repository contains the infrastructure setup for the HotLabel platform - a crowdsourced data labeling solution that replaces intrusive online advertising with micro data-labeling tasks.

## Architecture

HotLabel consists of four microservices:

1. **Publisher Management** - Handles publisher registration, configuration, and integration with client websites
2. **Task Management** - Manages the creation, distribution, and tracking of labeling tasks
3. **Quality Assurance** - Validates and verifies the quality of submitted task results
4. **User Profiling** - Manages user sessions and builds expertise profiles to match users with appropriate tasks

All services are deployed to a single GCP Compute E2 instance with the following infrastructure:

- **Kong API Gateway** - Routes requests to appropriate services
- **PostgreSQL** - Persistent storage for all services
- **Redis** - In-memory cache and message broker
- **Prometheus & Grafana** - Monitoring and observability
